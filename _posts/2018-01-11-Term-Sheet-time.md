Here’s an email we’ll frequently receive from clients. 

<i>“We’ve got a term sheet signed (see attached) and we’d like you to prepare the docs. Can you help us with this deal?”</i>

If you plan to hire a lawyer for a transaction, don’t wait until after the term sheet is signed to get your attorney involved. 

From a cost-to-value perspective, negotiating the term sheet is one of the best ROI you can get from a good attorney. Here are a few reasons why.  

## The Term Sheet Anchors Future Negotiations and the Ultimate Ending Point of Your Transaction.

I know this sounds obvious – isn’t the point of a term sheet to outline the key deal points and general understandings of a transaction? Yes, of course. But many attorneys, whether rightly so or not, use the term sheet as a sword to back the other party into a corner during negotiations of the definitive documents, even if the language in the term sheet is not explicit or very clear (see #2 below). During negotiations, you’ll frequently hear: <i>“You agreed to this in the term sheet, remember?”</i> or <i>“But, this point is already addressed in the term sheet.”</i> or <i>“Why are you trying to change the terms of the deal that we’ve already negotiated in the term sheet?”</i>

In the tension and conflict of a heavily negotiated deal point, it can be difficult to alter a term that has already been addressed, even unwittingly, in the term sheet. By agreeing to terms in advance without your attorney’s input, you will have placed your attorney on low ground against the other side in the negotiations, especially if your negotiating leverage is already thin. 

## Even Sophisticated Entrepreneurs and Investors May Miss Issues That A Good Lawyer Might Catch. 

Experienced transaction attorneys are trained to identify issues and think about nuances at the term sheet stage that non-attorneys may not catch. An example from a VC seed financing term sheet below:

>Anti-Dilution: Standard broad based weighted average anti-dilution, with customary carve-outs, including such carve-outs approved by the Board.

Assume you are an investor in the company. Does anything in in thebove give you hesitation? One point to consider – what do we mean when we reference "board approval?" 

Since preferred investors usually do not control the board at the seed stage, investors likely want the board approval to include the preferred director(s) for certain decisions, especially where the carve-outs involve option pool increases or other equity grants to founders and employees. Company counsel may argue based on the language above that the carve-outs need only be approved by the board collectively, with no special director approval right since the investor did not address this in the term sheet. 

I’m not saying that the company will win this argument, but the negotiations would be a lot smoother later on for the investor if this issue was already addressed at the term sheet stage – as the investor’s counsel, not only do you have to explain why you want this right, you also have to explain why your client apparently agreed to something else in the term sheet. To address this point, the investor may consider updating as follows:

>Anti-Dilution: Standard broad based weighted average anti-dilution, with customary carve-outs, including such carve-outs approved by the Board <b>including the Preferred Director</b>.

## An Attorney Can Protect You from Making Binding Commitments in the Term Sheet.

In most circumstances, you do not want or intend the term sheet to be binding for the deal you are negotiating. Your attorney can help you make sure that the language in the term sheet is clear regarding the non-binding intent of the term sheet. Your attorney can also help clarify aspects that you may want to be binding (confidentiality, no-shop clause, or fee reimbursements, for example).

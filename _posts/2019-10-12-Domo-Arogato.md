I recently helped a client negotiate a financing deal with SoftBank. In the course of negotiations, I noticed a few of idiosyncratic behavior from our Japanese counterparties. 

I am certainly not an expert in Japanese etiquette or behavior. However, I lived in Japan for a few years and I also received a bit of etiquette training when I externed at a big law firm in Japan for a summer. 

Here are a few tips and observations:

* Greetings in Japan are often formal and ritualized. At the law firm where I worked, I was instructed to use “Dear [Name of Recipient]” in every email. In a recent deal, I noticed that most of the business principals used the "Dear . . . " greeting in **every email**. 
* To address a colleague, use the person’s last name plus the word “san” (not gender specific), which is a formal way of saying Mr., Ms. or Mrs. 
* Punctuality is important. 
* Even if you think you will be meeting or jumping on a call with only one person, be prepared for a possible group meeting. 
* The traditional form of greeting in Japan is the bow, but for foreigners in a business setting, probably also okay to just shake hands. If you are greeted with a bow and you want to bow back, return your bow as low as the one you received, keeping your eyes low and your palms flat next to your thighs. 
* Try to follow up a meeting with a written summary or meeting minutes.
